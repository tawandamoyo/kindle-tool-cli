# Kindle Highlights Parser

This program parses and organises highlights (and notes) made on a Kindle ebook reader. These highlights are normally stored in a file called `My Clippings.txt` in the `Documents` folder of the Kindle.

The program creates a new folder named `books` in its root folder, and in that folder creates a `.txt` file corresponding to the title of each book.

## Introduction
The program takes the contents of a txt file and outputs them as separate text files named for each book.

Highlights on a Kindle are stored in a txt file in the following format:

To be natural and clean, like the water we drink, love must be free and mutual. But men demand obedience and deny pleasure.

Of the revolutionaries who began it all, not one remained. All were purged: buried, locked up, or driven out. And they were removed from official photographs and from history books. The revolution elevated to the throne the most mediocre of its leaders.

We make our own choices sometimes, sometimes they are made for us.

I have often thought that the world the god has made—in our time, at least—is not generally kind to good men. I do not know what that says about me and my own life.

We accumulate sins and guilt, just by moving through our days, making choices, doing, not doing.

They had taken a great risk, but you did that to get ahead in life.

The highlights follow a regular pattern, split by `==========`, 10 "="s. This allows us to split them at that point.

## Usage

You should have Node installed.

- run `node index.js path_to_file` where path to file is a relative or absolute path to the clippings txt file and you will see a new folder named books containing `.txt` files of your books. This folder resides in the same location as `index.js`.

For example if you have `MyClippings.txt` at `Home/Desktop/MyClippings.txt`, run:
 ```bash

 node index.js Home/Desktop/MyClippings.txt

 ```

## Requirements
- Node.

## Issues/ Improvements

- Currently the script does not distinguish betweeen Highlights and Notes
- There is no way to sort the highlights according to any criteria, be it when they were made or their location in the book
 

## Note
Project is still in development. Kindly report any issues.
